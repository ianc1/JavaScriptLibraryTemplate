# JavaScript Library Template
A basic project template to kick start your pure JavaScript library for browser clients.

The project is configured with the following tools:

- ESLint to keep a consist coding style throughout your project.
- Jasmine to write Behaviour-Driven unit tests.
- Karma to run the tests.
- PhantomJS to run the tests headless on your build server.
- Webpack to package and minify your code.

To get started, clone the repo and start coding!
